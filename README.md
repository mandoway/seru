# SeRu

SeRu is a framework to create semantic program reducers.

It is designed to help developers create program reducers using general and specific semantic reduction strategies.

To streamline the process of creating such a reducer, SeRu leverages the power of LLMs to bootstrap a reduction tool for a specific language.
