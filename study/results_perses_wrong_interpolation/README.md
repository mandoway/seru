Main difference:

- The ANTLR grammar used for Perses & Vulcan had a flawed implementation of string interpolations.
    - It was vastly improved which leads to a better syntactic understanding of CUE and therefore better reduction
      results from Perses.
    - Better results from Perses improve the whole process.
